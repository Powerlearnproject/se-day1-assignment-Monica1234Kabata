#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

   Software engineering is a branch of computer science that systematically applies engineering principles, programming, and scientific methods to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems.
-Provision of cybersecurity and data protection- well-engineered softwares provides companies and individuals with strong protection of their privacy and data by putting tight systems in place to avoid cybersecurity threats or breaches.
-Improving businesses' operational efficiency through automation of some traditional and manual processes.
-Reliability and Maintenance- It enables digital tools/products remain functional, updated, and free of critical bugs periodically through scheduling of maintenance checks.
-Innovation and problem-solving of real-life problems locally and globally in various industries such as healthcare, finance, and many more.
-Scalability and Growth – Well-engineered software allows businesses to scale operations efficiently, handling more users and transactions as they grow.
-Customer reach- it helps businesses develop digital tools that enhance customer reach both locally and globally.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The NATO Conference introduced the term software engineering to address the software crisis, emphasizing structured development and engineering principles.

-Rise of Structured Programming (1970s–1980s) – Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming to replace chaotic spaghetti code, leading to better software organization with languages like C and Pascal.

-Agile Manifesto (2001) – Agile development emerged, prioritizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer-focused software, replacing rigid Waterfall models with Scrum and Kanban methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning-Involves defining project goals, scope, budget, and timeline. At this stage, the risks and feasibility of the software are also identified.
2. Requirement Analysis  to answer what my software product solves by collecting user and business needs together with functional and non-functional requirements.
3. Design-Creates software architecture, UI/UX design, and database structures.Defines how different components will interact.
4. Development (Implementation)-Involves product engineering through Writing and coding the software based on design specifications using suitable programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
5. Testing and Intergration-Ensures the software is free of bugs, and errors, and meets requirements. It includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
6. Deployment-Software is released for users or clients. Can be found on various platforms such as Google Play Store and App Store for mobile products.Can involve beta testing before full-scale deployment.
7. Maintenance and Support-involves periodical system checks to fix bugs, improve performance, and update features as needed for the software to remain functional and relevant over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - There is minimal customer involvement-Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.
Best used in the following scenarios:
-Projects with large well-defined and stable requirements (e.g., government projects, financial software).
-Regulated industries where extensive documentation is required (e.g., medical software, aerospace).
-Simple, predictable projects with clear timelines (e.g., payroll processing systems).

Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- High customer involvement- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.
Best used in the following scenarios:
-Projects with evolving requirements (e.g., mobile app development, startups).
-User-driven applications where feedback is essential (e.g., e-commerce platforms).
-Fast-paced environments where quick iteration is needed (e.g., gaming, SaaS products).


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer
-Writes, tests, and maintains code.
-Translates requirements into functional software.
-Collaborates with designers and testers to ensure smooth development.
-reports to the project manager on the progress of the software development

 Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
-Tests software for bugs and performance issues.
-Ensures the software meets quality standards.
-Automates testing and reports defects for fixes.
-collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
-create standards and procedures to be met during software development.

Project Manager (PM)
-Oversees project timelines, budgets, and team coordination.
-Ensures requirements are met and stakeholders are updated.
-Manages risks and keeps the project on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)-is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform thus improving efficiency and streamlining development.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.

Version Control Systems (VCS)-are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time enabling them to:
-Track every change made by each team member, enable collaboration, and prevent code loss.
-Allow developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
-It also allows the branching and merging of new codes into the main code.
 Examples: Git, SVN, Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-Debugging Complex Code → Use systematic debugging, logging, and automated testing.
-Meeting Deadlines → Use Agile methodologies and prioritize tasks effectively.
-Keeping Up with New Technologies → Continuous learning through courses, books, and practice and adopting agile methodologies to be in the loop with the ever-changing technologies.
-Collaboration Issues → Use clear documentation, communication tools, and Version Control Systems like Git.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

-Unit Testing – Tests individual methods and functions of units, components, and modules used in the software to catch early bugs and ensures each unit performs its intended function, independent of each component.
-Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together correctly and data flows smoothly through those interfaces and modules as intended.
-System Testing – Verifies the entire application meets requirements including functionalities and interactions.
-Acceptance Testing – Confirms software meets user expectations before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective inputs that are specific, clear and curious to get accurate AI responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt-tell me about software engineering.
Improved prompt- Define software engineering, software products and their benefits to the technology world to various sectorsin 2020.

The improved prompt is better because one expects a clear and specific answer especially if one is a beginner on what software engineering and software products are and how they impacted the world positively in a specific period and the various fields.
